# bootcamp-java-spring
The good old bootcamp done in Java

This is my attempt at making this [Challenge](https://github.com/eduardohoraciosanto/Golang-Challenge) in Java using Spring & Maven.

I'll try to also implement 100% coverage on unit testing and to dockerize the app so it can run with just a Makefile target.
